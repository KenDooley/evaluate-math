# Evaluating mathematical expressions using Shunting-Yard Algorithm.

This code is really intended to go along with my talk (I'll upload the
slides later.) That said, if you want to get started, there are two
challenges!

## Evaluate Mathematical expressions.

Fill out code in stack.py, postfix.py, and evaluate.py until the tests
pass. You can run the tests with nosestests or better yet, pytest.

The solutions are in the complete folder, but try not to peak too early.

## Balanced Parenthesis!
I've put stubs for the balanced parenthesis problem in the balanced
folder, as well as some tests. I'm not providing solutions for this
(yet).
